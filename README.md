# No Gen AI Seal

This repo contains svgs and pngs of my custom No Gen AI assurance seal. It's inspired by [this one](https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal) and you can do whatever you want with it.

You can see it in use on [the Steam store page for my game Oh No! UFO!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314190/Oh_No_UFO/), which you could also wishlist if you like ðŸ˜‰.

There's an Affinity Designer file included if you want to make your own, or you can edit the svgs in any other vector editor. The font I used is [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter).

If you would like a seal that doesn't appear in this list, please open an issue and if I find time I'll add it. No promises, though ðŸ˜¬.
